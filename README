This project contains the source schema for describing state services, mainly services dealing with judicial branch in France.

For now, the RDF Schema is to be published further at http://www.datalift.org/ontology/stateservice/

I am sharing the schema in github so others can contribute edits and improvements. It is an experiment to see how well a service like github can work for collaboratively managing schemas.

To edit the schema, clone the repository, make your changes, check to make sure your change results in valid file.

If you are satisfied with your edits, send me a pull request (http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) I'll consider merging and publishing it later.

(Inspiration for this approach comes from others like https://github.com/rsinger/LinkedMARCCodes)
